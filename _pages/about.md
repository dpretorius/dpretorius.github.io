🌟 Hi there! I'm Daniella Pretorius, a passionate explorer in the fascinating realms of protein biochemistry and structural biology. Currently, I'm on an exciting journey pursuing my PhD at Imperial College London in the [James W. Murray](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/j.w.murray/about) lab. 🧬✨

🔬 My scientific adventure is driven by an insatiable curiosity to unravel the mysteries of proteins and to innovate novel structures that push the boundaries of bioengineering. 🧪🔍

🌍 I also had the incredible opportunity to join the [Sergey Ovchinnikov](https://www.solab.org/home) group as a visiting PhD researcher at MIT. This enriching experience has broadened my horizons and deepened my commitment to advancing our understanding of the biological world. 🌐🎓
