Hi there! I'm Daniella Pretorius, a curious mind diving deep into the world of protein biochemistry and structural biology. Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD at Imperial College London in the [James W. Murray](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/j.w.murray/about) lab. My journey in science is fueled by a passion for unraveling the mysteries of proteins and designing novel structures that push the boundaries of bioengineering. I was also welcomed by The [Sergey Ovchinnikov](https://www.solab.org/home) group as a visiting PhD researcher at MIT.
